    "In this Jupyter Notebook, we will be discussing several search algorithms applied on a maze using the pyamaze module. The main idea of this module is to assist in creating customizable random mazes and to apply search algorithms with ease. By using this module, you don't need to program the GUI, and you don't need the Object-Oriented Programming since the module will provide you the support. This module uses the Tkinter GUI framework which is built-in in Python and you don't need to install any framework to use this module.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyamaze is a Python module that allows for the creation and display of mazes, agents, and labels. It is a useful tool for visualizing various search algorithms and can aid in the understanding of their mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Depth-First Search (DFS)`, `Breadth-First Search (BFS)`, `Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)`, and `A*` are all popular search algorithms used in computer science. DFS and BFS are uninformed search algorithms, which means that they do not use any heuristic information to guide the search. UCS is a variant of BFS that takes into account the cost of each step, while A* combines both the cost and heuristic information to make informed decisions during the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses and is suited for different types of problems. DFS is useful for searching through large, unstructured spaces and finding paths that are deep in the search tree. BFS is best for finding the shortest path between two points, while UCS is useful for finding the path with the lowest cost. A* is generally considered the best search algorithm as it combines the benefits of both uninformed and informed search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, understanding the differences between these search algorithms and when to use them can be a valuable skill for solving complex problems in computer science.\n"
