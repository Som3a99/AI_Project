# AI_Project
This repository contains an implementation of a maze-solving
## AI project using four different algorithms:
```
DFS (Depth-First Search), BFS (Breadth-First Search), UCS (Uniform Cost Search), and A* (A-star). 
```

The project aims to find the optimal path through a maze by applying each of these algorithms and comparing their performance. The code is written in Python and includes detailed comments and documentation to help you understand the logic behind each algorithm. Feel free to clone this repository and modify the code to suit your needs.
